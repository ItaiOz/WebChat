WebChat program has created during semester B of my third year of studies.

The program implements use in chat website which based on Internet Programming languages such as JPA, MVC and Spring

Project has 3 pages: Login, main chat page and search page.

Most of efforts were done in chat page which demostrates use in database (that stores the messages and users) and creating queries to handle it.
navigating through pages made via spring and with establisihng a session bean which is valid through whole project. Images attached.
