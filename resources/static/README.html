<h2>Program Brief:</h2>
  <br>
<p>as part of our participation in Internet Programming language we got an exercise<br>
  to practice and implement what we've learn in the whole semester. We are working with<br>
  Spring, JPA and database in order to deliver the program in the best and efficient way.<br>
  <br>
  The program implements a chat page where each user can log in and text in the main page,<br>
  and receive messages from other users that are wish to log in.<br>
  Note that every name is unique and two users cannot log in from the same user name.<br>
  Users cannot send empty message. Every own message will appear in the left side on the chat page,<br>
  while other users messages will appear o =n the right side with difference in colors<br>
  5 messages will be displayed exactly - according to exercise demands.<br>
  On the left side of the chat window the online users will appear. users that have been out for 10 seconds<br>
  will be deleted from the window and won't appear.<br>
  While the user on the page, the window will be refreshed every 10 seconds for getting new messages and online users.<br>
  <br>
  There are to ways to navigate in the page. One way is to log off and return into the landing page.<br>
  The other option is to to be directed to the search page in order to look in the database for what the user wishes for.<br>
  There are two ways to search for results: The first is by user name and its messages,<br>
  While the second one is by messages.<br>
  Results will be found according to queries in the database<br>
